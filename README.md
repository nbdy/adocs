# adocs
[![Build Status](https://build.eberlein.io/buildStatus/icon?job=android_adocs)](https://build.eberlein.io/job/android_adocs/)
<br>android offline documentation viewer

### features
- [x] downloading/unpacking docs-24_r01
- [x] listing top level folders
- [x] documentation navigation (navigation menu / links)
- [x] onBackPressed support (goes to last visited link if in DocViewFragment)
- [x] favourites
- [ ] search

### why?
alternatives don't allow to read docs from sdcard<br>
i don't have any network reception at work<br>
but the urge to look at docs is always high<br>

### alternatives
[DroidDocs](https://github.com/erikcox/DroidDocs) - but apparently you'll need to compile it yourself and move the unpacked documentation into /app/src/main/assets/
