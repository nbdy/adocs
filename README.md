# adocs
[![Build Status](http://build.eberlein.io:8080/job/android_adocs/badge/icon)](http://build.eberlein.io:8080/job/android_adocs/)
<br>android offline documentation viewer
### why?
alternatives don't allow to read docs from sdcard<br>
i don't have any network reception at work<br>
but the urge to look at docs is always high<br>

### alternatives
[DroidDocs](https://github.com/erikcox/DroidDocs) - but apparently you'll need to compile it yourself and move the unpacked documentation into /app/src/main/assets/
